Reliable, resilient, and adaptable, I have worked on various projects, gaining experience in GCP, AWS, and the integration between both platforms. I have handled end-to-end data processes, encompassing the entire pipeline from data ingestion to user delivery. I am proficient in both streaming and batch processing, utilizing technologies such as NiFi, Kafka, Flink (Kinesis), Dataflow (Beam), Glue (Airflow), S3, Athena, relational and NoSQL databases, and other relevant tools. While Python is my primary programming language, I am also proficient in Java, Kotlin, GoLang, and JavaScript.
