Hi! I'm Marcello!

I'm currently a Data Engineer, working with streams, data ingestion, real time and near real time transformations, lake formation and other data related subjects.
Usually I code in python, but when needed I can work with groovy or java.
In my free time I like to play CTF and build web pages for friends, just to practice :)
I'm hoping that you can find useful code in these repos!
